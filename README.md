# puppet-approved-modules

This repo will track module approvals, if you would like to submit your module for review, please open an issue with all relevant information outlined. 

## How can I get my module ‘Approved’? 

If you feel that your module is actively maintained and meets the guidelines published [here](https://forge.puppet.com/about/approved/criteria), then all you need to do is create an issue in puppet-approved-modules and one of our team will get around to checking it as soon as they can. They will provide feedback on anything they need to, or award you an ‘Approved’ badge.

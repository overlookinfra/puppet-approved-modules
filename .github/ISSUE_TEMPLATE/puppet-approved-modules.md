## Puppet Module Approval Request

 - [ ] I can confirm I have checked my module against the [Approved module criteria](https://forge.puppet.com/about/approved/criteria) and I think it is a suitable candidate.

Please include the module Github URL *(include namespace and module name)*,
**For example**: https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-motd
